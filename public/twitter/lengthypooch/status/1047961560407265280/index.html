					Mastodon is open-source software that can run on multiple sites at once (sorta like wordpress).
					every instance of mastodon can talk to each other â€” it's a global network formed out of individual
					communities, each hosted somewhere unique and maintained independently of the others

					... I trust that friend to make changes to the software that suit my needs, and to respond quickly
					and effectively to any issues I have (compare with twitter/facebook support). if I ever feel that
					trust isn't being valued, I can move to another instance.

					the core issue is that a mass migration from twitter isn't likely. I'm doing it because I need a
					reason to take a break, and I'm excited by the vision of social media it offers, even if there won't
					be immediate results. feel free to dm if you have any qs or want to join too!
