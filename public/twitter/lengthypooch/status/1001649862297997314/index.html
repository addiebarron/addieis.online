  	      I think a common answer is that it's a kind of performance that isn't sanctioned by normative culture, but that also seems wrong. sluttiness as an aesthetic is a foundational part of straight culture &amp; nationalism imo.

  	      another answer is that we're changing the meaning of it to take away the (male) referent, so it becomes a reclaimed form of feminine expression defined without an object. that's more convincing to me, but it's not new. (black) gay/trans culture was way ahead of the curve on that
