  	      "personal responsibility" models pale next to communitarian sustainability and self-governance ones — with collective pwr we cn boycott + teach each other + rly dent the forces of climate destruction — but one of those models is not in the interest of the neolib state / corps

  	      this is a huge part of why tensions w/ MOVE were escalated by the phl police. another huge part was the fact that cops can't stand black people with guns, learning gun safety and self-defense, teaching each other how to use guns. this is at the core of what police ARE lol
