  	      self-teaching is highly valued in coding circles. it represents a sort of vagabond drive and innate skill. many of the most famous programmers were autodidacts.<br><br>that said, it is also often met w gatekeeping in the form of condescension, dogmatism, &amp; nitpicking over conventions.

  	      things like cleanliness, commenting, documentation, &amp; modularity are ultimately matters of preference, even though there are often good arguments to be made for certain options over others. self-taught coders must decide on their own which options to use in their work.

  	      as a woman in a code-adjacent field (web support), I've been lauded for my capacity for self-teaching. yet when I reach out for help (often to white men in stable dev jobs), im struck by their inability to consider my lack of "industry" experience and convey information flexibly.

  	      the other day, I wanted to write some test API calls as prep for a big data migration project I'm helping with. I asked a superior whether I should work on a personal server or a company server. he made me feel silly for not distinguishing btwn "servers" and "machines"

  	      as a self-taught coder with only one computer, and never having worked on a dev team, I had only had experience using the term "server" — and not the full specifics of what it describes. but suffice it to say that the distinction ended up being totally meaningless for my project.

  	      I don't think he was being malicious at all, and I did end up learning something through that conversation. but at the end of it, I felt less willing to ask for guidance and help in the future. I ended up teaching myself the rest of what was needed for the project. vicious cycle

  	      programming, especially on the web, is a historied and complex field that developed outside of academia — it can't be *entirely* self-taught bc the human element is too large.<br><br>but the current dog-eat-dog culture of tech isn't suited to thoughtful, caring education and mentorship
