  	      and, also to their benefit, when we as critics focus on this perception of tech giants as malevolent wizards with access to overpowered dark psychic magic we ignore the underlying economic motivations &amp; flows that are the real problem with silicon valley, esp monopolization

  	      like, imo, social media is actually a huge failure of technology on all counts. it isn't able to bring about the good OR the evil it claims to. it's just a bloated bad idea w a pack of goons at its helm weaving these stories to make sure we stay convinced of its importance

  	      this is how most ideas that come out of silicon valley work - smoke and mirrors. uninteresting ideas painted with lots of nice ad copy and ui sugar. rich people masquerading as bad people masquerading as good people
