					hey if u want to leave twitter, consider joining a mastodon server, it's like a bunch of
					independently run twitters that can talk to each other. there are lots of servers with lots of
					different purposes. we can follow each other no matter which one u join

					I'm currently @addie@friend.camp (<a
						href="http://friend.camp/@addie">http://friend.camp/@addie</a>). you can easily join a big
					general-purpose server like <a href="http://mastodon.social">http://mastodon.social</a> to get
					started. maybe I'll even start my own server someday ...
