  	      I do think it's more important than ever for musicians to be in communication with music tech. historically it's been music journalists, labels, and venue owners who've served as "extensions" of music scenes out of the underground. why hasn't that been the case for coders?

  	      the people who build technology have a huge influence on how money and information moves. if you have a relationship with them, they can build tools that are more in the interest of the communities they feel they're a part of. as it stands, the "tech community" is v impartial.

  	      a machine learning dev at Spotify could easily split and work for Amazon the next day. that person has no allegiance to or investment in anything that could remotely be called a "scene". yet, they're designing and implementing the code that determines how artists get $$/exposure.
