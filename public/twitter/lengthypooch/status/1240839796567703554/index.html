					hi so tomorrow Bandcamp is waiving the 10-15% revenue share we usually collect from sales, meaning
					artists get 100% of funds from purchases. u should buy from artists tomorrow but im gonna quickly
					sound off about why i think buying music directly is important in general

					first of all, why buy music when streaming exists? well, streaming subscription services are not a
					profitable model; they're only able to exist and be profitable because they pay pittances for
					artists' labor &amp; intellectual property. if they seem too good to be true, that's why

					this isn't just an ethical issue, it affects quality. as streaming becomes the predominant model,
					musicians w less income / free time can't make a living bc most of their labor is being converted
					into corporate profit. in spotify's world, rich ppl are the only ones making music

					before the internet, many artists couldn't make a living just from selling their songs. network
					technology shouldve expanded those bands' reach &amp; thus their capacity to support themselves.
					instead, corps found a way to change the musical paradigm and shift that new value upwards

					obviously market solutions aren't ideal, but by purchasing music directly from artists we can make a
					point to shift that paradigm back to a more direct model, where artists' labor and the value they
					receive for that labor are more proportional
